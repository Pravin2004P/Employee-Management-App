## About The Project

This project is a comprehensive Employee Management Application designed to streamline the process of managing employee data within an organization. It typically allows for basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records, and may include features for tracking personal information, contact details, roles, departments, and more.

### Built With

* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
* [Java](https://www.java.com/)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) (for dependency management)
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) (for database persistence, common for such applications)
* *(Optional: Add frontend technologies here if applicable, e.g., [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) for server-side templating, or mention if it's a backend-only API.)*

---

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of this Employee Management Application up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
* Apache Maven (or use the included Maven wrapper)
* A MySQL server instance running and accessible (or another database if configured differently).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Pravin-Sonwane-2004/Employee-Management-App.git](https://github.com/Pravin-Sonwane-2004/Employee-Management-App.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Employee-Management-App
    ```
3.  **Configure Database:**
    * Create a MySQL database (e.g., `employee_db`).
    * Update the `src/main/resources/application.properties` (or `application.yml`) file with your database connection details:
        ```properties
        # application.properties example for MySQL
        spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/employee_db?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
        spring.datasource.username=your_mysql_username
        spring.datasource.password=your_mysql_password
        spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update # Use "create" or "create-drop" for initial setup, then switch to "update"
        spring.jpa.show-sql=true
        ```
    * Ensure your MySQL server is running and accessible.

4.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean install
    # On Windows, use:
    # mvnw clean install
    ```

---

## Usage

This application is typically run as a Spring Boot service, which exposes API endpoints for managing employee data.

To run the application:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
# On Windows, use:
# mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Once the application is running, you can interact with its API endpoints using tools like Postman, curl, or integrate it with a frontend application.

Example API Endpoints (conceptual):
* `GET /api/employees` - Get all employees
* `GET /api/employees/{id}` - Get a specific employee by ID
* `POST /api/employees` - Create a new employee
* `PUT /api/employees/{id}` - Update an existing employee
* `DELETE /api/employees/{id}` - Delete an employee

---

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/Pravin-Sonwane-2004/Employee-Management-App/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

* [ ] Implement user authentication and authorization.
* [ ] Add frontend UI (e.g., using React, Angular, or Thymeleaf).
* [ ] Integrate search and filtering capabilities for employees.
* [ ] Add pagination for large employee datasets.
* [ ] Implement unit and integration tests.
* [ ] Dockerize the application for easier deployment.
